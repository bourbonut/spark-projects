# Full Machine Learning Process

This project aims to understand how Spark RDD, Spark DataFrame and Spark Dataset work.
Also a complete pipeline to train a model is done (usage of `StringIndexer`, `OneHotEncoder` and `DenseVector`).
A model is trained based on the pipeline and the accuracy is computed at the end of the program.
